# Spotify Analytics Pipeline on GCP

## Project Overview
This project builds an **end-to-end event-driven data pipeline** to extract, process, and analyze Spotifyâ€™s top 50 Bollywood songs. It leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services for scalability, automation, and analytics. The pipeline follows the medallion architecture, processing data in bronze (cleaned) and gold (business-ready) layers, with results staged in BigQuery for analysis.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **GCP Services**:
  - **Cloud Storage**: Compressive, scalable data storage
  - **Pub/Sub**: Asynchronous messaging between producer and consumer
  - **Cloud Run**: Serverless processing for event-driven functions
  - **Cloud Scheduler**: Cron jobs to schedule workflows
  - **Dataproc**: Apache Spark clusters for big data processing
  - **Cloud Composer**: Workflow orchestration using Apache Airflow
  - **BigQuery**: Data warehouse for analytics
  - **Looker**: Dashboard creation and data visualization

## Architecture Workflow
### Stage I: Data Extraction
1. **Spotify API Integration**:
   - Data pulled from Spotify API using a **Python script** deployed on **Cloud Run**.
   - Messages sent to a **Pub/Sub topic** for decoupled and scalable data processing.
2. **Storage**:
   - Data pushed to **Cloud Storage buckets** for logging and further processing.

### Stage II: Data Processing
1. **Bronze Layer**:
   - Data cleaned and converted from JSON to Parquet using **Dataproc Spark Job 1**.
   - Output stored in a separate Cloud Storage bucket.
2. **Gold Layer**:
   - Processed `artist` and `album` data from the bronze layer into gold using **Dataproc Spark Job 2**.
   - Extracted `track_info` data and staged it in **BigQuery** using **Dataproc Spark Job 3**.

### Stage III: Orchestration
1. **Cloud Composer (Airflow)**:
   - DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) defined to orchestrate the pipeline.
   - Tasks include converting JSON files, combining data, and loading it into BigQuery.
   - Workflow dependencies managed to ensure seamless execution.

  - Bronze layer: Cleaned data.
  - Gold layer: Analytics-ready data.
- **Workflow Automation**:
  - Scheduled and monitored with Cloud Composer.
  - Optimized processing workflows with PySpark jobs.
- **Scalable Analytics**:
  - Final data stored in BigQuery for large-scale analysis.
  - Visualized insights with Looker dashboards.

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites
1. **Spotify Developer Account**:
   - Sign up: [Spotify Developer Portal](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
   - Obtain Client ID and Client Secret.
2. **GCP Services**:
   - Enable APIs for Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Cloud Run, Cloud Scheduler, Dataproc, Cloud Composer, and BigQuery.

### Steps
#### Stage I: Data Extraction
1. **Create Pub/Sub Topic**:
   - Topic name: `Spotify-etl`
2. **Deploy Python Script to Cloud Run**:
   - Extract Spotify API data and publish messages to Pub/Sub topic.
3. **Create Subscription and Storage Bucket**:
   - Subscription filters relevant data.
   - Store raw JSON data in Cloud Storage.

#### Stage II: Data Processing
1. **Run Dataproc Spark Jobs**:
   - **Job 1**: Convert JSON to Parquet (bronze layer).
   - **Job 2**: Process `artist` and `album` data (gold layer).
   - **Job 3**: Extract `track_info` and publish to BigQuery.

#### Stage III: Orchestration
1. **Set up Cloud Composer DAG**:
   - Define tasks and dependencies for each stage.
   - Upload DAG to the `dags/` folder in Cloud Storage.
2. **Schedule Workflow**:
   - Use Cloud Composer to automate and monitor the pipeline.

## SQL Query for Verification
Once data is loaded into BigQuery, run the following query to verify:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `YOUR-PROJECT-ID.SPOTIFY_ANALYTICS.TRACK_INFO`
ORDER BY artist_name;
```

## Output and Analytics
- **Processed Data**:
  - Stored in BigQuery for further analysis.
- **Visualization**:
  - Insights displayed through Looker dashboards.
